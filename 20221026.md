Nothing bothered Josie more than trying to learn something new without first looking at practical examples.

The professor knew Josie well, so he wasn't surprised when she stood up with four different scenarios during his presentation about Recurrent Neural Networks.

Her question was straightforward but made everyone think:

Which of the following scenarios can you model using a Recurrent Neural Network?

1. A model that takes a fixed-size vector as the input and outputs a sequence of vectors.

2. A model that takes a sequence of vectors as the input and outputs a fixed-size vector.

3. A model that takes a sequence of vectors as the input and outputs a sequence of vectors.

4. A model that takes a fixed-size vector as the input and outputs a fixed-sized vector.

[Recurrent Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) (RNNs) have several advantages over vanilla neural networks. One that helps answer this question is their ability to use sequences of vectors, both as their input and output.

A feed-forward network, for example, is limited to taking a fixed-size input vector and outputting another fixed-size vector. Unfortunately, this characteristic limits their usefulness.

Generating an image caption is an example of a model that requires a fixed-size vector as its input (the image) and a sequence of vectors as the output (the generated caption.)

Sentiment analysis is an example of a model that takes a sequence of vectors as its input (the text) and outputs a fixed-size vector (a numerical value indicating the sentiment.)

To build a model capable of translating text from one language to another, we could use a sequence of vectors as the input (the original text) and output another sequence of vectors (the translation.)

Finally, we don't need an RNN to build a model that takes a fixed-size vector as its input and output, but that doesn't mean that RNNs don't support this structure. [Here is an example](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7755) using an RNN to process a picture (fixed-size vector) and outputs the number on the image (fixed-size vector.)

In summary, we could build an RNN model with any structures listed in this question.
