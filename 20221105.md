Here is the Fβ score formula:

![](20221105.jpg)

The Fβ score lets us combine precision and recall into a single metric.

Let's say you want to use this formula to measure a model where higher precision is more important.

What's the correct value for the β parameter to achieve this?

1. β = 0

2. β = 0.5

3. β = 1

4. β = 2

1, 2


The Fβ score lets us combine precision and recall into a single metric. When using β = 1, we place equal weight on precision and recall. For values of β > 1, recall is weighted higher than precision; for values of β < 1, precision is weighted higher than recall.

When β = 0, the Fβ score only takes precision into account; therefore, the correct answers to this question are β = 0 and β = 0.5.
