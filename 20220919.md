title: "Learnable parameters"

Arianna is trying to learn how Convolutional Neural Networks work, so she decided to copy an online Keras example to start from somewhere.

Here is the core of the code she put together:

```python
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation="relu"),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation="relu"),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax"),
])
```

Based on the above code fragment, what are the correct statements regarding each layer's parameters (weights and biases)?

1. The first convolutional layer has a total of 21,632 parameters.

2. The first max pooling layer has a total of 5,408 parameters.

3. The second convolutional layer has a total of 18,496 parameters.

4. The fully-connected layer has a total of 16,010 parameters.

We can compute the number of parameters of a convolutional layer using the following formula:
```
parameters = k * (f * h * w + 1)
```

Where k corresponds to the number of output filters from this layer, f corresponds to the number of filters coming from the previous layer, h corresponds to the kernel height and w to the kernel width. The value 1 corresponds to the bias parameter related to each filter. Here is the complete calculation for the first convolutional layer:
```
parameters = k * (f * h * w + 1)
parameters = 32 * (1 * 3 * 3 + 1) = 320
```
Max pooling layers don't have any parameters because they don't learn anything. The input to the first max pooling layer is 26x26x32, but the layer doesn't have any weights or biases associated with it.

The second convolutional layer does have 18,496 parameters. Let's check:
```
parameters = k * (f * h * w + 1)
parameters = 64 * (32 * 3 * 3 + 1) = 18,496
```
Finally, the fully-connected layer has 16,010 parameters. To compute this, we need to calculate the size of each layer to understand the input to the fully-connected layer:

Input: `28x28x1 = 784`  
Conv2D: `26x26x32 = 21,632`  
MaxPool2D: `13x13x32 = 5,408`  
Conv2D: `11x11x64 = 7,744`  
MaxPool2D: `5x5x64 = 1,600`  

We can use the same formula to compute the number of parameters of the output layer:
```
parameters = 10 * (1600 + 1) = 16010
```
